Hi! I’m Raph and I’m looking for a job.
    <br>
<span class="indent"></span>
I am about to finish my 4th year at Massey University's Creative Campus in Wellington studying Visual Communication Design. Outside of studying I surf, hang out with friends and enjoy the odd bit of partying. 
    <br>
<span class="indent"></span>
I’m a designer who works across multiple disciplines such as web, print, video and animation. I have a fairly good level of ability across the Adobe Creative Suite, but as always with these programs, I still have a lot to learn.
    <br>
<span class="indent"></span>
I am hard working, open minded, able and willing to take initiative, punctual and reliable.

                <br>
                <br>

Raphael and I worked together on a feature film named Close Enough (2015) where his role was 1st AD (assistant director). Raphael was in a situation where he had to learn his role in a very short amount of time. He handled the pressure of this and was very quick to learn his responsibilities. He was very professional but still fun on and off set. He worked extremely well with the rest of the crew and was a great presence to be around. 
 <br>
<span class="indent"></span>
Raphael is very talented and passionate about the arts and design. He is a very down to earth person and incredibly open and easy to get along with. He shows up and is very reliable. Since after the film I had hired and worked with Raphael on another job for him to be 1st assistant camera. I knew he would be able to handle the role and work ahead. He also did a great job and showed great communication and organisation skills on this job. I would be happy to work with Raphael again as he is really a pleasure to work along side.
                <br>

Yours sincerely
