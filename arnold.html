                The purpose for this book was to tell the story of how bodybuilding (and gym culture as a byproduct) came to be such a big part of our society. The catalyst for this was the film ‘Pumping Iron’. The book attempts to tell the story of the film and provide a more balanced look at some of the claims made in it.

The typeface I chose to use for my headings and to integrate with the different body parts of the body builders was Cooper Black. Cooper Black is often used to appear jovial and unthreatening – a big friendly giant of a typeface – but I have subverted this and used it for its bulky, heavy, bursting at the seams nature of the font.
I chose to use a baby pink tone because that was one skin tone that all of the body builders shared, even Serge Nubret’s palms were pink, so it seemed like the most representative colour choice. It also help to offset the incredible amount of testosterone coming off the page.

Type was placed on the edges of the page to create a feeling of it trying to bust out of the page through sheer bulk and power. This was offset by relatively ‘safe’ placement and setting of the body copy to try and give the reader some breathing space.I also applied this to the pacing of the spreads, the ebb and flow of the layouts was set that it started out with a confronting image of Serge and then straight into a full page of massive Cooper Black. It slowly came back down until and reached a low with the centre spread of all of his competition placings. Then three hard hitting, big letters and confronting quotes on the next spreads. Then back down until the last two spreads which have smaller headings, ‘safe’ copy and a lot of space on the pages. I chose to use Helvetica Neue as a nod to all the original publicity, type in the film and poster in which Helvetica was used for all of the above. I made the decision to staple bind the book because of the sort of raw nature of using them. It also tied in well with referencing back to Pumping Iron, the staples being made out of metal.

I designed two versions of the book, one silver and one black, initially to see which one worked best. I then liked how they interacted together as a duo so kept them both as the final product.
